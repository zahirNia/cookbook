<h1>Mirsa Gassemie</h1>
<P>Here is a recipe of a tasty and simple Iranian dish. It's a bit like Omelette but with love, I mean eggplants of course. Generally the dish is somewhat flexible-- please feel free to adjust the quantities to your taste. I personally like the dish with more onions and garlic as you can see in the pictures. I hope you enjoy it!!</P>
