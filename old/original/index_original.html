<P>Here is a recipe of a tasty and simple Iranian dish. It's a bit like Omelette but with love, I mean eggplants of course. Generally the dish is somewhat flexible-- please feel free to adjust the quantities to your taste. I personally like the dish with more onions and garlic as you can see in the pictures. I hope you enjoy it!!</P>

<h2>Instructions in 6 steps</h2>

<h3>Step 1</h3>
<P>Originally the eggplants are supposed to be grilled on real fire. This gives them a unique taste. I used my oven instead like below. Let them inside for 45 min at 170-180°C.</P>

<h3>Step 2</h3>
<P>After 45 minutes, let them cool. In the meantime, cut your onions and garlic and grate the tomatoes (or use a mixer). Your result should look something like this.</P>

<h3>Step 3</h3>
<P>Its should be now fairly easy to peel the eggplants off which we do in this step and then using a mixer or a simple knife bring them into real tiny pieces.</P>

<h3>Step 4</h3>
<P>Its should be now fairly easy to peel the eggplants off which we do in this step and then using a mixer or a simple knife bring them into real tiny pieces.</P>

<h3>Step 5</h3>
<P>Now we start frying everything! Start with the eggplants, after 5 minutes, add the onions and garlic, after they all got a bit golden, add the tomatoes, bring the oven lower, put a lid on top of the pan and let it cook for another 10 minutes. You’ll have something like this at the end of this step.</P>
